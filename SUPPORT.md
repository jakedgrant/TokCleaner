# Support

Need help with TokCleaner? I'm here to help!

## Getting Support

Choose whichever method works best for you:

- **Email**: [support@tokcleaner.app](mailto:support@tokcleaner.app?subject=TokCleaner%20Support)
- **GitHub Issues**: [Submit an issue](https://github.com/jakedgrant/TokCleaner/issues) (if you have a GitHub account)

## Reporting Issues

Don't worry about getting everything perfect! Just tell me what happened and I'll work with you to figure it out. That said, here are some things that really help me understand and fix issues faster:

### What Helps Most

- **Describe what happened** - Just tell me what you were doing and what went wrong
- **Include the TikTok link** - The specific video URL helps me test with the same content
- **Screenshots or screen recording** - A picture is worth a thousand words! If you saw an error or something unexpected, a screenshot really helps
- **What you expected** - What did you think would happen?

### Tips for a Great Bug Report

The app can automatically include your device and app version info if you use the "Report Issue" button in the Support screen (coming soon!). But if you're emailing, here's what's helpful to mention:

- Your device model (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro)
- Your iOS version (Settings > General > About > iOS Version)
- What you were trying to do
- What actually happened instead

### Example

Here's what a helpful report might look like, but don't stress about the format:

> I tried to watch this TikTok video: https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/1234567890
>
> I tapped the share button, selected TokCleaner, but the app opened to a blank screen. I expected the video to start playing.
>
> I'm on an iPhone 13 with iOS 17.2.
>
> [screenshot attached]

That's it! I can work with whatever information you can provide.

## Common Issues

Before submitting an issue, check if your problem is listed here:

### Video Won't Load
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Try copying the TikTok link and pasting it directly into Safari
- Verify the TikTok video is still available (not deleted)

### Share Extension Not Appearing

- Restart your device
- Check if the share extension is enabled in iOS Settings
