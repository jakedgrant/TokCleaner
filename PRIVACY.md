# Privacy Policy for TokCleaner

**Last Updated:** November 7, 2025

## What Our Extension Does

TokCleaner is a Safari extension for iOS that removes tracking and query parameters from TikTok URLs to provide a cleaner, more private browsing experience.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any data whatsoever.**

- We do not collect information about the websites you visit
- We do not collect your browsing history
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not use cookies or tracking technologies
- We do not collect analytics or usage statistics

## How the Extension Works

Our extension uses Safari's declarativeNetRequest API to automatically remove query parameters (everything after the "?" in a URL) from TikTok links. This processing happens entirely on your device using Safari's built-in capabilities.

**Example:**
- Before: `https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/123?ref=share&tracker=abc`
- After: `https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/123`

All URL processing occurs locally on your device. No data leaves your device, and we have no servers that receive any information.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **Access to tiktok.com domains**: Required to detect and process TikTok URLs
- **declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess**: Required to modify URLs before they load

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of removing query parameters from TikTok URLs.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## How to Disable

You can disable this extension at any time by:
1. Opening Settings on your iOS device
2. Navigating to Safari → Extensions
3. Toggling TokCleaner off
