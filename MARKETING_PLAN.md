## App Store Optimization (ASO)

### App Store Copy

**Name:** Paramless

**Subtitle:** Remove TikTok URL Trackers

**Description:**
```
Clean TikTok Links. Protect Your Privacy.

One-time payment. No subscription. No data collection.

Paramless removes tracking parameters from TikTok URLs automatically in Safari. Cleaner links, more private browsing.

FEATURES:
• Automatic tracking parameter removal
• Works seamlessly in Safari
• Zero data collection - completely private
• Lightweight and fast
• No account or login required
• Works on all TikTok URLs

HOW IT WORKS:
Enable the extension in Settings → Safari → Extensions, and Paramless does the rest. Every TikTok link you visit is automatically cleaned, removing tracking parameters for a better browsing experience.

PRIVACY FIRST:
We don't collect, store, or transmit any data. All URL processing happens locally on your device. Your browsing stays private.

EASY SETUP:
Settings → Safari → Extensions → Enable Paramless

Buy once, use forever. Perfect for privacy-conscious users who want cleaner, tracker-free TikTok links.

2. **Personal Network**
   - Share on personal social media
   - Post in your Stories/feed about the launch
   - LinkedIn post about building your first iOS app

### Phase 2: Community Launch (Weeks 3-4)

**Product Hunt:**

### Phase 3: Content & SEO (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Organic discovery

## Conversion Optimization

### Review Strategy
**Ask for reviews strategically:**

- Use StoreKit native review prompt (not intrusive)
- Only ask once

**Respond to all reviews:**
- Thank positive reviewers
- Address negative feedback constructively
- Show you're actively maintaining the app

### Pricing Psychology
**Why $1.99 works:**
- Impulse buy territory
- Higher than $0.99 (shows quality)
- Lower than $2.99 (accessible)
- Respectable for your time
- "Coffee price" comparison

**Messaging:**
```
"The price of a coffee for lifetime privacy protection.
No subscriptions. No tracking. Just peace of mind."
```
